# Pokémon Card Search Engine
An ongoing front-end project that will allow users to search Pokemon cards based on the card's stats such as attack costs and typing so that players can find cards to put into their decks. 

Built using [the Pokémon TCG API](https://github.com/PokemonTCG/pokemon-tcg-sdk-javascript), React and Vite, the app presently allows users to search for cards based on names and filter results based on rarity.

The project is currently paused whilst I finish my intensive studies.
